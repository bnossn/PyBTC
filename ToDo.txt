-Note: the cash used for a trade will be the minimum of the two exchanges, minus 1.00% as a small margin: 
if there is $1,000 on the first account and $1,100 on the second one, $990 will be used for each exchange, i.e. $1,000 - (1% * $1,000). The exposure is $1,980

-Create a SpreadTarget that takes into account the fees. SpreadTarget = The targeted profit
If SpreadEntry is at 0.80% and trades are generated at that level on two exchanges with 0.25% fees each, Blackbird will set the exit threshold at -0.70% (0.80% spread entry - 4x0.25% fees - 0.50% target = -0.70%)
res.exitTarget = res.spreadIn - params.spreadTarget - 2.0*(res.feesLong + res.feesShort);
Use checkEntry / checkExit Functions?

-Add trailling for closing a trade as well. (Opposite to that for openning the trade)

-Do the exchange commands time management manually

-Fix the ordering of the args of the functions open_trade and close_trade
