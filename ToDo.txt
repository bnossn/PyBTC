-Fixed a bug when a calculating minimum Spread - ok
-Change the way you deaal with PairData - ok
-Create a SpreadTarget that takes into account the fees. SpreadTarget = The targeted profit - ok




-Do the exchange commands time management manually. Needed?

-Fix the ordering of the args of the functions open_trade and close_trade



-Use the unsync library to do multiprocessing, multithreading and asyncIO all at once.

-Script so considera o valor da melhor oferta sem considerar volume


-Instantiate all the ccxt objects (exchanges) outside the async function and pass it to the async as parameter. Does this handle Rate Limit better?
What about the .close()?

-Orders are cached - call purgeCachedOrders(before) from time to time to clean it




-Cast exchanges globally - ok
-Create exchange pair between buying and selling exchanges - ok
-Create an dict that holds the minimum amount of crypto that can be traded for each coin (Set Minimum withdraw for each crypto) - ok
-Compute price based on the trading volume (Average of the price for 3 times the volume your are considering buying) - ok
-Break the loop for finding opportunity as soon as the first opportunity is found (With break). Do the fetch_order_book again before openning a new position. - ok
-Separate exchange in two list: The ones you can buy (withdraw) and the ones you can sell (Deposit) - ok
-Update real_balance according to the SimMode. - ok


-Create a bool for SimMode (Simulation mode cannot use private methods)
-Create a timedelay to simulate transaction time
-Count a min number of loops that an opportunity is available before openning a position (e.g. 2 times)
-Find a safe way to read the API key

-If two opportunities sends crpto to the same exchange at the same time, closing trades might be difficult. Maybe the open time recorded can help with that?

-has_bid_liquidity was never used

you should create the exchange instance inside the process worker function, not outside of it (don't pass it into the other process, because the memory is not shared that easily – google more about shared memory with processes).

-OpenTrade / CloseTrade have to return whether the trading was successful.
