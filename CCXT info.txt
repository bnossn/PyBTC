The user should check if the market is active and reload market cache periodically, as explained below.

Take care of each currency Precision And Limits (amount and price for both) when placing an order
   -This does not influence most of the orders but can be significant in extreme cases of very large or very small orders
   -The user is required to stay within all limits and precision! The values of the order should satisfy the following conditions (look on manual):
   -A negative amount precision means that the amount should be an integer multiple of 10 (to the absolute power specified) (market['precision']['amount'] == -1). decimal_to_precision() can handle that
   -decimalToPrecision fuction can be used. (There are code examples in the folder)
